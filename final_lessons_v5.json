He is interested in the science club, but he also likes the gaming team. It is a difficult choice! He decides to join the gaming team. The guide, Mr. Cohen, welcomes him. \"Nice to meet you,\" says Mr. Cohen. \"We depend on good players.\" Nadav is happy. He realizes that this will be an amazing journey. Later, Nadav goes to the cafeteria for a meal. He eats a bowl of pasta with salt and pepper. He talks to his friends about the danger of the boss in their favorite video game.
