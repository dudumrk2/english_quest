            text: "Last winter, my family decided to take a special trip. 'Let's go somewhere cold!' Dad suggested. So, we booked tickets and flew on a large plane all the way to Italy. The purpose of our journey was simple: to have a wonderful ski vacation. Upon our arrival, the country looked amazing. White snow covered everything, especially the tall mountains. It was a cool experience to see so much white! We rented a small wooden house near the ski resort. 'This place seems magical,' my sister said. We normally go to the beach, but this time, we wanted a real winter adventure. Throughout the week, we learned to ski and drank hot chocolate. It was the best recent memory I have.",

'I must find help,' I thought. I looked for anyplace with people. Then, I saw a light. A ski patrol officer came towards me. He offered to guide me back to safety. 'You are lucky,' he said.
