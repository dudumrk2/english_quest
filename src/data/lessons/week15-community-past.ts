            text: "Last Friday was supposed to be an ordinary night, but it turned into a drama. My friends and I planned to go to the central cinema to watch a new action movie. Everyone was excited, especially Sarah. However, when we arrived at the ticket counter, a problem took place. I opened my wallet and realized I didn't have enough cash. 'Oh no!' I thought. 'Did I leave my money at home?' I felt so embarrassed. I didn't want anyone to know. But Sarah noticed my face. 'Do you have a problem?' she asked. I explained the situation quietly. She didn't hesitate. She took out her credit card and insisted on paying for me. 'It's fine,' she said. 'In fact, treat me to popcorn next time.' Although it started badly, we watched the movie and stayed out until midnight. It was a night to remember.",

We had a talk and I realized my mistake. 'I'm sorry I didn't believe you,' I said. 'I didn't mean to be rude.' Tom smiled and let go of his anger. 'It's okay,' he said.
