He could climb walls and shoot webs.\n\nPeter decided to use his powers to help people. He made a cool suit and called himself Spider-Man. He fights bad guys and saves the city. But he also has normal problems. He has homework and exams.\n\nPeter\u0027s job is not easy. He has to form a plan. Usually, he follows the bad guys and confronts them directly. He receives a lot of praise. He must also feed his cat, write his history essay, and not fall in love too fast! He would prefer to just be a normal student. He even has to fill out a form for his physics homework. It\u0027s a lot of work.\n\n(Bonus Vocabulary for this lesson: serve.)",
